            <h4>"Re-load Summary" button:</h4>
            <p>Save current selections and annotations and re-display the summary page. Use this option to display new sequence versions arising
               from edits in the alignment view. 
                 <b>Always reload the the summary view and check selections before saving assignments and quitting.</b> </p>

        <div id="save">
          <h4>"Save Assignments" button:</h4>
          <p>Saves current selections and annotation results in an assignment file and merges these assignments into the current model file. Please 
             also note that upon clicking "Save Assignments" button, the saved in-progress sequence annotation is also removed by default.</p>

          <p>End the current session without updating assignment and model files in the archive directory. </p>

	  <h4>"All Done" button:</h4>
          <p>End the current session and update the archive with any save assignments.</p>

	<div>
          <h4>"Save in-progress sequence annotation to archive" button:</h4>
          <p>This option will save the current selections and annotation into archive directory. The saved information will be reused if 
             sequence module is re-started from the work flow manager. Use this button if you want to save current sequence annotation, but 
             also need to update model file (through other modules or editor), and then re-run sequence module to finish sequence assignment.</p>

	<div>
          <h4>"Remove in-progress sequence annotation from archive" button:</h4>
          <p>This option will remove the saved current selections from archive directory. Please also note that upon clicking

            <p>An alternative one-letter code sequence with modified residue in parenthesis may be entered for the entity sequence. 
               Alignment will be re-generated upon submitting the new sequence. It is the most convenient way to add tags at the termini.</p>
            <p>For chimera protein, please split the sequence by absolute range and provide appropriate source tax id.</p>
            <p>An option of "Add instances from entity" at the bottom is provided to consolidate all of the instances from another entity 
               into the current entity. The entity without instances is effectively deleted and will not appear in the updated model file.</p>

	      moved to the left, and is the destination of the end
	      residue of the block if the block is being moved to the
	      right. All numbers entered should be positions within
